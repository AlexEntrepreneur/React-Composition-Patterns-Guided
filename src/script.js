//====== Higher Order Functions (HOF)======//
// There are many different uses of HOF

// Callbacks
// 1- HOF as a function executer


// 2- HOF as a Function Factory


// 3- HOF as an object enhancer (injecting new properties)
// This is simiar to Higher Order Components in React!
// Functions here = Components
// Objects here = JSX Elements
